# QR Code Generator

> made this in like an afternoon to create QR codes for my supplemental instruction session students to mark their attendance.

This is a simple QR code generator built with React, Vite and tailwind. You type your desired URL into the input box, it gives you a QR code. You can even download the qr code if you're feeling fancy.
